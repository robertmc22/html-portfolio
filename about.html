    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Eric Sums</strong>, and I'm a passionate learner currently building my skills in web development. 
        I love exploring new technologies, solving problems, and continuously improving my knowledge in coding and design. This website 
        is part of a course project, where I'm putting my skills into practice. When I'm not coding, I enjoy WATCHING MOVIES, gaming, and staying 
        up-to-date with the latest in tech!
